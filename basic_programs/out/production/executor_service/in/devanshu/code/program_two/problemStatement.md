# Problem Statement

Create a fixed thread pool with a specified number of threads using Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int). Submit multiple tasks to this executor, where each task should print the current thread's name and sleep for a random time between 1 to 5 seconds. Finally shutdown the executor and handle proper termination using awaitTermination.
